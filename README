initial "backport" of moto specific 720 capabilities
based on the latest published from motorola hardwara omap3

my tests (just compile) are ok

so far, so good, but this repository was not the correct one..
the correct one is omap3-compatible
but anyway, will not delete this one (but please don't use it for building:)


as this repository was forked from nadlabak one, it seem pretty much like the one we have to use
sorry for the confusion
